@Jaystreezy wtf? I feel sorry for your momma!
@StayingInMyLane can't wait until u return hawks can use u out there.
@RealMikeRob my life as a dad... Cool interview.  Thanx for that
@FlashoftheOKG It's not about the league. ... it's about the court system...
@FlashoftheOKG hahaha. Below you? I guess I'm the privileged one here. Don't suppose you can give me a autograph could you?
"@FlashoftheOKG how did u know ""how many people follow me then? Are we twitter beefing.  Lol."
"@FlashoftheOKG so besides our little debate. .. the only thing that is factually is that you followed me, and lied about it? LoL. Cool thanx"
@FlashoftheOKG does it not say u followed me??
"@FlashoftheOKG soooo. I made that up? I have 8 followers?  Didn't realize I had that many. Never use this, this is all new to me bud"
@FlashoftheOKG http://t.co/vCO4gvNSqY
@FlashoftheOKG hahaha. Name calling is fun.
@FlashoftheOKG let it go bud.  Live your privileged life.
"@FlashoftheOKG  You chose to follow me on Twitter,  insult me, And now your comparing your intelligence to mine?  Be happy with your life"
@FlashoftheOKG @DougBaldwinJr the grass is always greener on the other side.Stop comparing ur life to pro athletes.You will always be bitter
"@FlashoftheOKG nope,  if a video came out about you hitting your wife. .. nobody would care.  No offense."
"@FlashoftheOKG to appease people like me? Lol. Wait, are you not entertained by television?  Do you not watch Football?  It's people like us"
"@FlashoftheOKG @DougBaldwinJr I wasn't referring to your feeling. More like his ""privileged"" job can fine him for any negative thing."
@FlashoftheOKG @DougBaldwinJr I just mean he might get fined for doing so. His job could fine him for speaking his mind. Would yours?
@FlashoftheOKG @DougBaldwinJr do you think it's a privilege 4 db not to be able to tell u to fuck off?
"@FlashoftheOKG huh? Take the same player and put him in jail for the punishment,  and bet Nfl would have been more strict"
"@FlashoftheOKG and 2 the other point,  we live in a privileged society.  If you owe taxes you don't get murdered.  Stop hating on db man"
"@FlashoftheOKG yes, that was kinda my point,  but I look at the police as the fault here. Nit the nfl's punishment."
@FlashoftheOKG @DougBaldwinJr @Tinker_Ten it's all relative to how you view things.
@FlashoftheOKG @DougBaldwinJr @Tinker_Ten store without being hounded.  Or your address being leaked out and bothered at your home
"@FlashoftheOKG @DougBaldwinJr @Tinker_Ten yeah, not really feeling that. There is a flip side to that also. You are privileged to go to the"
"@FlashoftheOKG @DougBaldwinJr Privileged?  By your definition,  are all entertainers Privileged?"
Didn't they see the video? Yet only slapped Rice on the wrist.  That seems to be the bigger picture here. Not the NFL's punishment
@DougBaldwinJr @FlashoftheOKG @Tinker_Ten Why is the NFL the only thing taking heat over this? Do the police have the same tapes as NFL?
@DougBaldwinJr @Kam_Chancellor @bwalt19 proof!
Feeling a bit depressed.  Losing confidence on work
